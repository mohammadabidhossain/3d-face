# 3D Face Model Webpage

This project is a simple webpage that displays a 3D face model using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). The model is loaded from a GLB file (`abid.glb`) and rendered with basic lighting and orbit controls, allowing users to rotate, zoom, and explore the model interactively.

## Features
- 3D face model rendered with Three.js
- Interactive orbit controls for rotation and zooming
- Basic lighting setup for depth and visibility
- Responsive design that adjusts to window size

## Demo

## Prerequisites
To run this project locally, you’ll need:
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
- A local server (e.g., VS Code Live Server, Node.js `http-server`, or Python’s `http.server`) to serve the files due to browser security restrictions on loading local GLB files.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mohammadabidhossain/3d-face.git
